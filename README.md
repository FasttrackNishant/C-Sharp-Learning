# C Sharp Fundamentals

This repository contains C# basics to advanced examples, organized for quick learning and practice. It is intended for learners who want a concise path from syntax fundamentals to object-oriented programming and practical snippets.

## Features

- Fundamentals: variables, data types, operators, control flow, methods, and error handling.
- Object-oriented programming: classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Collections and LINQ: arrays, lists, dictionaries, and LINQ queries.
- Asynchronous programming: tasks and async/await basics.
- Practical console samples demonstrating common patterns and idioms.

## Getting Started

- Prerequisites:
  - .NET SDK (latest LTS recommended).
  - An editor like Visual Studio or VS Code with the C# extension.
- Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/FasttrackNishant/C-Sharp-Learning
- Build and run:
  - Navigate to a project folder and run:
    - dotnet build
    - dotnet run

## Suggested Learning Path

1. Basics: syntax, variables, types, operators, and flow control.
2. Methods and exceptions for reusable and robust code.
3. Collections and LINQ for data processing.
4. OOP pillars: classes, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.
5. Async/await for responsive apps and I/O operations.

## Repository Structure

## License

Add a LICENSE file if a specific license is intended (MIT is common for educational code). If none is provided, consider adding one so others know how they can use the code.

## Acknowledgments

- .NET and C# documentation for language concepts and examples.
- Community tutorials and guides that inspire the structure and topics.

## About

This repository aims to provide a straightforward, example-first way to learn and revise C# fundamentals through small, focused programs.
